**SLE (Single Loss Expectancy):**  
Estimated cost of one significant cyber event.

**ARO (Annualized Rate of Occurrence):**  
Estimated probability that a significant incident will happen in a year.

**ALE (Annualized Loss Expectancy):**  
Expected yearly financial loss due to cyber incidents.  
**Formula:** `ALE = SLE Ã— ARO`

**ROI (Return on Investment):**  
How much value you get from investing in controls.  
**Formula:** `(Risk Reduction Ã· Control Cost) Ã— 100`

**Cost vs. Risk Reduction Ratio:**  
A ratio < 1 means your spend is efficient for the risk reduced.

**User Breach Cost:**  
Cost of providing credit monitoring to affected users.

**Downtime Cost:**  
Lost revenue or costs due to operational disruption.

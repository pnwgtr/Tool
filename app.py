This calculator models the potential financial impact of a significant cyber event based on our organization's digital footprint and business operations.

**Key Factors in Our Risk Surface:**
- **{user_count_k}K user accounts** containing sensitive personal data
- **Mission-critical systems** that cannot be down for extended periods
- **Third-party integrations** and vendor dependencies
- **${revenue:,.0f} in annual revenue**, reliant on continuous uptime
- **Preventative control spend of ${controls_cost:,.0f} annually**

These factors contribute to a heightened risk profile and help define the variables below:
- **SLE** (Single Loss Expectancy) = base + user + downtime costs
- **ARO** (Annual Rate of Occurrence) = yearly likelihood of a breach
- **Downtime cost** = outage days √ó daily cost
- **Controls cost** = annual spend
- **Program maturity** = _{maturity_level}_ (adjusts ARO)

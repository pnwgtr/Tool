This calculator models the potential financial impact of a significant cyber event based on our organization's digital footprint and business operations.

**Key Factors in Our Risk Surface:**
- **{user_count_k}K user accounts** containing sensitive personal data
- **Mission-critical systems** that cannot be down for extended periods
- **Third-party integrations** and vendor dependencies
- **${revenue:,.0f} in annual revenue**, reliant on continuous uptime
- **Preventative control spend of ${controls_cost:,.0f} annually**

These factors contribute to a heightened risk profile and help define the variables below:
- **SLE** (Single Loss Expectancy) = estimated loss from one significant incident (base + user + downtime costs)
- **ARO** (Annual Rate of Occurrence) = estimated yearly likelihood of a breach
- **Downtime cost** = based on expected outage days √ó cost per day
- **Controls cost** = annual spend to reduce likelihood and impact
- **Program maturity rated as _{maturity_level}_**, influencing how likely incidents are to occur

**SLE (Single Loss Expectancy):**  
Estimated cost of one significant cyber event.

**ARO (Annualized Rate of Occurrence):**  
Probability a significant incident happens in a year.

**ALE (Annualized Loss Expectancy):**  
Expected yearly financial loss due to cyber incidents.  
**Formula:** `ALE = SLE √ó ARO`

**ROI (Return on Investment):**  
Value gained from investing in controls.  
**Formula:** `(Risk Reduction √∑ Control Cost) √ó 100`

**Cost vs. Risk Reduction Ratio:**  
Ratio < 1 means efficient spend.

**User Breach Cost:**  
Credit monitoring cost for affected users.

**Downtime Cost:**  
Lost revenue due to operational disruption.
